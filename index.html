                <h4>Food for a family</h4>
                <p>Many of the families that are affected by the flood have lost their ability to earn such as farmers.
                    So it is up to us to provide them with foods so they won't starve and become unhealthy.</p>

                <p>Most families in the disaster area have their homes destroyed by the flood. We can build many
                    shelters to help those people recover from the flood.</p>
