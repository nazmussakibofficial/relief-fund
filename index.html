        <h2>Our Donation Plans</h2>
        <p>We have divided our main goals into three parts to fulfill our duty more efficiently</p>
        <div class="flexible">

                <img src="images/food.png" alt="">
                <h4>Food for a family</h4>
                <p>Many of the families that are affected by the flood have lost their ability to earn such as farmers.
                    So it is up to us to provide them with foods so they won't starve and become unhealthy.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="custom-details-color1" class="plan-details">
                <img src="images/shelter.png" alt="">
                <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
                <p>Most families in the disaster area have their homes destroyed by the flood. We can build many
                    shelters to help those people recover from the flood.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="custom-details-color2" class="plan-details">

                <h4>Education for a child</h4>
                <p>Education is one of the basic human rights. The children that have been affected by the flood are no
                    exceptions. So they have to be provided with proper education system also.</p>
